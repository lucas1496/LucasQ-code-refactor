## Horiseon Webpage Code Refactor

In this repository you will find all the files related to the refactored Horiseon webpage.

The webpage has been optimized in the following ways:
- The index.html file has been completely optimized with semantic HTML elements that follow a very logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- alt attributes have been added to every image element
- All heading attributes now fall in sequential order
- Title element of the page has been updated from "website" to "Horiseon"

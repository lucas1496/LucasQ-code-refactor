- The index.html file has been completely optimized with semantic HTML elements that follow a very logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- alt attributes have been added to every image element
- All heading attributes now fall in sequential order
- Title element of the page has been updated from "website" to "Horiseon"
- Application's links all function correctly now
- Application's CSS selectors and properties are now consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
- Descriptive comments of the changes have been added to application's CSS file
